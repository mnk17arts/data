### Project Description

> `Finger Counter Project` is a simple python project made using OpenCV and Mediapipe library. This project is used to count the number of fingers and show the number of fingers on the screen. 

+ In this project we firstly detect the hand using the `mediapipe` library and then we use the `OpenCV` library to show the number of fingers on the screen.

> What all I have used in this project?
>  * `mediapipe` library
>  * `OpenCV` library
>  * `time` library
>  * `math` library
>  * `datetime` library
>  * `os` library
>  * `Hand Tracking Module` [->](https://github.com/mnk17arts/myPython/tree/main/opencv/hand-tracking-module)

+ The `Hand Tracking Module` is used to detect the hand. The `Hand Tracking Module` is made using the `mediapipe` library. The `Hand Tracking Module` is available in the Github repository. You can download the `Hand Tracking Module` from there. The link to the Github repository is [Hand Tracking Module](https://github.com/mnk17arts/myPython/tree/main/opencv/hand-tracking-module)

+ The Hand Landmarks are used to count the number of fingers. The Hand Landmarks are shown on the screen. The Hand Landmarks are shown in the following image:
