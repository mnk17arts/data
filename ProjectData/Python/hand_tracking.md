### Project Description

> `Hand Tracking Module` is a simple python module made using OpenCV and Mediapipe library. This module is used to track the hand and show the landmarks of the hand on the screen. This module is very useful in many applications like [virtual paint project](https://github.com/mnk17arts/myPython/tree/main/opencv/virtual-paint-project), gesture volume control etc.

+ In this module we firstly detect the hand using the `mediapipe` library and then we use the `OpenCV` library to show the landmarks of the hand on the screen.

> What all I have used in this module?
>  * `mediapipe` library
>  * `OpenCV` library
>  * `time` library
>  * `math` library
>  * `datetime` library

+ FPS also shown on the screen. 

> What is the FPS?
  * FPS stands for Frames Per Second. It is the number of frames that are displayed in one second. The FPS is shown on the screen.

+ The code of this module is nicely commented. So you can easily understand the code. The code is available at the Github repository. You can download the code from there.
