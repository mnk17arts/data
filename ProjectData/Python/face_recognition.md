### Project Description

> `Face Recognition Project` is a simple python project made using OpenCV and face_recognition library. This project is used to recognize the face of a person and show the name of the person and the confidence score on the screen. This project is very useful in many applications like attendance system, security system, etc.

+ In this project we firstly detect the face of a person using the `face_recognition` library and then we use the `OpenCV` library to show the name of the person and the confidence score on the screen.

> What all I have used in this project?
>  * `face_recognition` library
>  * `OpenCV` library
>  * `numpy` library
>  * `os` library
>  * `datetime` library

+ We have a folder of images which consists of the details of the input data. So we compare face encodings of these data and the recognized face and then we show the name of the person and the confidence score on the screen.

> What is the confidence score?
  * The confidence score is the percentage of the face which is matched with the input data. The higher the confidence score the more the face is matched with the input data. The confidence score is shown on the screen.

> What is the face encoding?
  * The face encoding is the 128-dimensional face encoding of the face. The face encoding is used to compare the face of the person with the input data. The face encoding is calculated using the `face_recognition` library.

+ The code of this project is nicely commented. So you can easily understand the code. The code is available at the Github repository. You can download the code from there.
