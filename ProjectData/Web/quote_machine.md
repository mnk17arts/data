### Project Description

> `Quote Machine` is simple web app that genereates random quotes made with simple HTML, SCSS (CSS) and JavaScript. It fetches quotes from an API and displays them on the screen. 

+ It has a button that generates a new quote when clicked. For every new quote, the background color changes to a random color.

+ Even if we don't click the button, the quote changes after a certain interval of time.
