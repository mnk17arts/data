### Project Description

> `Pomodoro Clock` is a simple responsive static web application made using simple HTML, SASS(CSS), JQuery & JS. It's like a simple pomodoro clock with basic operations like start, pause, reset and stop.

**Note** : *This is a simple static website. It doesn't have any backend. It's just a simple pomodoro clock.*

+ It has a timer which counts down from 25 minutes and then it starts counting up from 5 minutes. It has a start, pause, reset and stop button. It also has a sound which plays when the timer is over.

+ What actually is a pomodoro clock? It's a timer which is used to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
