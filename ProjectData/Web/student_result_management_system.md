### Project Description

> `Student Result Management System` project is a dynamic web-based application that mainly focuses on providing the results to the student and the faculty. Both the student and faculty are given with respective user id credentials by the administration. Here in this project I my self created those credentials in the database. In this project I created to portals. Faculty and Students portal.

+ Students can login using their credentials on the students portal and view / print / download their results.
+ Faculty can login using their credentials on the faculty portal and edit / modify / update / delete the results of the students. They can even add new student's to the database. (But the login credentials are not by them. I created the credentials of these new students in the database.)

**Note** : *In actual `Student Result Management System (SRMS)` faculty can't modify or add new data. They can only view the student results. In normal SRMS the data is managed by a separate department (like the administration). But in this project I created the faculty portal to show the CRUD operations.*

> What all I used in this project :-
> + Web : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
> + Database : MySQL (XAMPP)
> + Server : Apache (XAMPP)

- The complex part of the project was intergrating login system with the database. I used PHP to connect the database with the login system. I used MySQL database to store the data. I used XAMPP to run the server and the database. I used Apache to run the server. I used PHPMyAdmin to manage the database.

- The Home page of the project is the login page. Here the user can login using their credentials. If the user is a student then he/she will be redirected to the student portal. If the user is a faculty then he/she will be redirected to the faculty portal. If the user enters wrong credentials then he/she will be redirected to the login page again. The login system is created using PHP. The home page is shown as below.
