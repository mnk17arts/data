### Project description

> `React Redux - Get Users` is a simple react project made using React, Redux, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk, React-Router and Axios. This project is used to show the list of users and their details from the public API. 

+ In this project we firstly fetch the data from the public API using the `Axios` library and then we use the `Redux` library to store the data in the store. Then we use the `React-Redux` library to get the data from the store and show the data on the screen. We also use the `React-Router` library to show the details of the user on the screen.

+ The home page contains buttons each one of them represent a user. These users are fetched from the public API. When we click on the button of a user then we are redirected to the details page of that user. The details page contains the details of the user.

+ And in that details page that user is fetched from the store using the `React-Redux` library. The details of the user are shown on the screen.
