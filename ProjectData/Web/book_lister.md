### Project Description

> `Book Lister` is simple web application made with simple `Html`, `Css` and `Js`. We can store our book lists here. For storage purpose, I used the Chorme local storage. The app is very simple and easy to use. The Home page contains a simple UI with a form and table component. 

+ In form component, you can add the book name, author name and the ISBN number. After adding the book, an alert notifiction is shown and then the book will be added to the table component. The table component will show the book name, author name and the ISBN number. You can also delete the book from the table component. The app is very simple and easy to use.

> What all I used in this project :-
> + Web : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
> + Storage : Chrome Local Storage

- The complex part of the project was intergrating the form component with the table component. I used JavaScript to intergrate the form component with the table component. I used Chrome local storage to store the data. I used JavaScript to get the data from the local storage and show it in the table component.

- Data is stored in the form of Key-Value pair in the chrome local storage. The snapshot of local storage is shown as below.

![Local Storage]()

- The structure of the data store is as follows.

```json
{
    "book1": {
        "bookName": "Book 1",
        "authorName": "Author 1",
        "isbn": "1234567890"
    },
    "book2": {
        "bookName": "Book 2",
        "authorName": "Author 2",
        "isbn": "1234567890"
    },
    "book3": {
        "bookName": "Book 3",
        "authorName": "Author 3",
        "isbn": "1234567890"
    }
}
```
